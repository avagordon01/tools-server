have the server epoll over the stdout and stderr connections
    start by printing it
    use websockets for communication between the frontend and backend
    wrap the data in JSON
    write a small c webserver
have the server listen for multiple connections and add them to an epoll list
call the harness beside hadean_init in aether
write the server JSON wrapping code
write the server pushing data out
write a web frontend to the server

dup2 forwarding isn't going to work if we want to wrap it in JSON in the harness
it's gonna be a painful event loop nightmare on the harness to not do dup2 forwarding
