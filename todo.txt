need to fix before merging
and may need zircon team help
    scheduler ip is in an environment variable
    put it in a submodule in zircon
    integrate it with the build system
    figure out how to have gdb exit on good program exit, to not leak processes
        killall gdb works

red animated highlight on activity

full ip+pid
the other input not considered is signals, sending sigint to gdb for example
    buttons on each cli to send sigint or other signal
    remotebreak doesnt seem to work
full integrated cpu/network/crash debugger
    add netvis
    add a d3 live graph of the metrics output

protocol things
    specify which pid(s) to send message to
    send process name as well as pid
interface things
    add an input bar seperate from each cli
    add a way to select which clis to broadcast to
        (currently just tickboxes?)
    and a button to invert the selection
    change the display order
        most recent output
        least recent output
    change the display
        tabs
        grid
    hide/show some clis
    filter clis
        by process name
netvis integration
    ss in a loop
    "time" in a loop, but with memory and cpu time stats
