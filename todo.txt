wtf the toolstreams vector has two of the three elements' m and s fields zero
    but they have all read/written data
    and the uv loop tcp handles are good
    why does uv have seperate handles to the ones passed in
complex tool
    add input going from the client to the tool
flashy tool
    change from gdb to something that prints out metrics regularly
    most flashy would be netvis integration
    start with either ss loop or time loop
